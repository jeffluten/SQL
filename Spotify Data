For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

-Creating the table: 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integr PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

- Artists and the average popularity of their songs from most to least popular.

SELECT  artist_name, avg(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity desc
;

- Artists ranked by danceabliity.

SELECT artist_name, danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE 'danceability' >=90
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY danceability desc
;

- The ten most popular tracks and who they're by.

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10
;
